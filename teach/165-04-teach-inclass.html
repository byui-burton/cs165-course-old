        <h1>04 Teach : Team Activity - Developing a Class Model</h1>


        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>You Mom's restaraunt is doing great, but she is having a hard time managing all of the orders, so she has turned to you for help.</p>

        <h1>Instructions</h1>
        <p>As a team, develop a class model that can handle the orders of this restaurant. It should provide a way to process customers, menu items, and their orders. Don't forget to account for prices, taxes, tips, etc., as well as customer information (such as payment methods).</p>

        <p>On the white board, draw a UML diagram of the classes you will need for this program. Please note that there is not "one true way" to handle this scenario, but be prepared to discuss and defend your choices.</p>
