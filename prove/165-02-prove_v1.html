        <h1>02 Prove : Assignment - Digital Forensics</h1>


        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>ACME Widget Corporation just experienced their first digital security breach. One of their secret widget designs just appeared on the Internet. Now they've hired you as a digital forensics investigator to help determine what additional data might have been involved in the breach.</p>
        <p>One of the first steps in digital forensics is to inspect system logs, particularly file access and user account logs. To assist you in this investigation, you've been given a log from ACME's network server that contains a list of file access times and the users that accessed them.</p>

        <p>Write a program to scan through that log to identify users who accessed files in a particular window of time.</p>


        <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <p>
                Write a C++ program according to the following:

                <ol>
                    <li>Create a struct for a Date that holds a year, month, and day.</li>
                    <li>Create a struct for an Access Record that contains a username, a filename, and an access Date (i.e., a Date struct).</li>
                    <li>Prompt the user for the name of a file.</li>
                    <li>Read in a list of Access Records from the file and store it in an array of structs.</li>
                    <li>Prompt the user for a start date and an end date for consideration.</li>
                    <li>Display a list of all files that were accessed during that period along with the users that accessed them.</li>
                    <li>For this assignment you may assume that the information entered is all valid</li>
                    <li>Don't forget to break your program into meaningful, cohesive functions!</li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <p>A few hints</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A common technique for comparing custom items is to create a function, such as compareDate, that takes two Date structs and returns -1 if the first one comes before the second, 0 if they are equal, and 1 if the first comes after the second.</li>
                <li>It is also common to create a function, such as displayRecord, that would take a struct and display it in a proper format.</li>
                <li>Get started early, there are a few tricky aspects to this assignment.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Sample Output</h2>
        <p>
            The following is an example of output for this program:
        </p>
        <div class="code">
Enter the access record file: <span class="user-input">/home/cs165new/assign02a.txt</span>

Enter the start date:
Year: <span class="user-input">2015</span>
Month: <span class="user-input">8</span>
Day: <span class="user-input">3</span>

Enter the end date:
Year: <span class="user-input">2015</span>
Month: <span class="user-input">9</span>
Day: <span class="user-input">2</span>

The following records match your criteria:

Date            File                 User
